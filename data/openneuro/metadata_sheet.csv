To improve comprehensibility in the noisy scanner, the audio was normalized to 70 dB and slowed by 20% with the pitch-preserving PSOLA algorithm implemented in Praat software. This moderate amount of time-dilation did not introduce recognizable distortion and was judged by an independent rater to sound natural and to be easier to comprehend than the raw audio recording. The audio presentation lasted 12.4 min. After giving their informed consent, participants were familiarized with the MRI facility and assumed a supine position on the scanner gurney. Auditory stimuli were delivered through MRIsafe, high-fidelity headphones (Confon HP-VS01, MR Confon, Magdeburg, Germany) inside the head coil. The headphones were secured against the plastic frame of the coil using foam blocks. Using a spoken recitation of the US Constitution, an experimenter increased the volume stepwise until participants reported that they could hear clearly. Participants then listened passively to the audio storybook. Upon emerging from the scanner, participants completed a twelve-question multiple-choice questionnaire concerning events and situations described in the story. The entire session lasted less than an hour.",Natural Language Comprehension,No,No,Human,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2016.04.008,,"Hale, John T."

The key details of the study include:  - **Participants**: The study encompasses 82 adult burn patients admitted to the ICU. - **Randomization**: Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group received standard care in addition to a maximum of six Music therapy sessions provided by a certified music therapist over a 2-week period. - **Electrophysiological Measures**: Electrophysiological measures were taken from a subset of 9 participants in the intervention group (11%). - **Ethics and Registration**: The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá (FSFB) with approval IDs CCEI-11234-2019 and CCEI-11971-2020.
